# Reports
A reporting service, much like Danbooru's [Reportbooru](https://github.com/danbooru/reportbooru).

This service is meant to be ran in tandem with the primary [FemboyFans](https://github.com/FemboyFans/FemboyFans) application.
It needs a clickhouse instance, and a redis instance (preferrably in its own database).
