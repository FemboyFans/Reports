# Reports
A reporting service, much like Danbooru's [Reportbooru](https://github.com/danbooru/reportbooru).

This service is meant to be ran in tandem with the primary [Paws Movin'](https://github.com/PawsMovin/PawsMovin) application.
It should share the same postgres instance (different database), and redis instance.
